# Crowd Tracker
### By Team- Eternity

#### Project Objective
The fundamental point of our venture is the track swarm at a specific metro station and recommend a man go to a metro station which is lesser crowder.

In the Go Green activity, we actualized an e-rickshaw booking strategy. E-rickshaw is the most ideal approach to movement short separations.

*****************
#### WHAT EXACTLY IS CROWD TRACKER?
It is a product that aims upon reducing the time and effort of the user via an android application.

The user will input its location and its preferred date and time for traveling via metros.

Our system will predict the list of nearby metro stations (rank-wise) according to crowd intensity to optimize user travel time.

Further, we have added one more feature “book your ride” and guess what?

Your ride will be an e-rickshaw.

Reasons for this:
 + Environment-friendly in terms of pollution.
 + Resource pooling in order to cut traffics on roads.
